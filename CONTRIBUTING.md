# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Before getting started:

1. Please make sure to read this document carefully.
2. Discuss the changes you wish to make by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/tchx84/Gameeky/issues/new).

## Understanding the goal

Gameeky is a learning tool in the form of a game engine. It's not a game engine that's also useful as a learning tool. Therefore, its primary goal is to provide a better learning experience for programming, arts and other STEAM skills. It's not a goal to provide an efficient nor professional game development process. You can read more about this project rationale [here](https://blogs.gnome.org/tchx84/2023/12/15/gameeky-a-new-learning-tool-to-develop-steam-skills/).

If you're looking for a tool to create professional video games, I highly recommend the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.

## Making changes

The process is well explained in this [article](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github), so you can simply follow these instructions to create pull requests.

The only request is that you [organize](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/) your commits in a way that makes sense. Please, do not send a single commit with too many changes.

Additionally, you can add your name to [the list of contributors](./src/gameeky/common/widgets/about_window.ui) in a separate commit.

## Adding new translations

To add a new translation simply run these commands on the terminal:

```sh
# Fedora requirements
$ sudo dnf install meson desktop-file-utils appstream python3-black python3-pyflakes python3-mypy python3-pytest python3-pytest-timeout python3-gobject gtk4-devel

$ cd Gameeky
$ echo "es" >> po/LINGUAS # e.g adding Spanish translation

$ meson setup _translate
$ cd _translate
$ ninja gameeky-pot
$ ninja gameeky-update-po

# Edit the newly created po/es.po
# Commit the changes and create a new Pull Request
```

## Testing your changes

This project comes with automated tests that you can run, even before you submit your changes. Simply run these commands on the terminal:

```sh
# Fedora requirements
$ sudo dnf install meson desktop-file-utils appstream python3-black python3-pyflakes python3-mypy python3-pytest python3-pytest-timeout python3-gobject gtk4-devel

$ cd Gameeky
$ meson setup _test --prefix $PWD/usr

$ cd _test
$ ninja install

```
