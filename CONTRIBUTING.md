# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Before getting started:

1. Please make sure to read this document carefully.
2. Discuss the changes you wish to make by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/tchx84/Gameeky/issues/new).

## Understanding the goal

Gameeky is a learning tool in the shape of a game engine. It's not a professional game engine. Therefore, its primary goal is to provide a better learning experience for programming, arts and other STEAM skills. It's not a goal to provide an efficient nor professional game development process. You can read more about this project rationale [here](https://blogs.gnome.org/tchx84/2023/12/15/gameeky-a-new-learning-tool-to-develop-steam-skills/).

If you're looking for a tool to create professional video games, I highly recommend the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.

## Getting started

The following is the recommended way for getting started:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/tchx84/Gameeky/fork) the project.
2. Install [GNOME Builder from Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder)
3. Open Builder and select "Clone Repository..."
4. Clone `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Gameeky.git`
5. Press the Run â–¶ button

## Making changes

The process is well explained in this [article](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github), so you can simply follow these instructions to create pull requests.

The only request is that you [organize](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/) your commits in a way that makes sense. Please, do not send a single commit with too many changes.

Additionally, you can add your name to [the list of contributors](./src/gameeky/common/widgets/about_window.ui) in a separate commit.

## Changing the user interface

All the user interfaces were built with [Cambalache](https://flathub.org/apps/ar.xjuan.Cambalache). Therefore, it's the recommended tool for manipulating the *UI* files of this project.

## Adding new translations

Gameeky requires that both the user interface and the beginner's guide are translated. To translate the user interface to a new language, see [po/README.md](po/README.md).

To translate the beginner's guide, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Testing your changes

This project comes with automated tests that you can run, even before you submit your changes. Simply run these commands on the terminal:

```bash
# Fedora requirements
$ sudo dnf install meson desktop-file-utils appstream python3-black python3-pyflakes python3-mypy python3-pytest python3-pytest-timeout python3-gobject gtk4-devel

$ cd Gameeky
$ meson setup _test --prefix $PWD/usr

$ cd _test
$ ninja install
$ meson test
```

## Windows support (experimental)

To run on windows, install [msys2](msys2.org) and follow the instructions to set up a development environment. Once the setup is done, install the following dependencies:

```bash
$ pacman -Suy
$ pacman -S git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-meson mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gtk4 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python3-gobject mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libadwaita mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gstreamer mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gst-plugins-good mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gtksourceview5 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-librsvg mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-desktop-file-utils
```

Additionally, [download](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and copy `pandoc.exe` to `msys2/usr/bin`.

Lastly, make sure to copy gettext ITS files from `msys2/ucrt64/share/gettext/its` to `msys2/usr/share/gettext/its`.
