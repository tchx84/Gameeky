" Similarly, search for *Gameeky* and follow the website instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lastly, it can also be installed from the terminal:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thematic packs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gameeky provides packs of predefined building blocks for different "
"interests, e.g., a farming role playing "
"[game](https://github.com/tchx84/FreedomValley) set in a medieval fantasy "
"world. A thematic pack contains:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Assets like tilesets, sprites and sounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Entities created from these assets, with predefined properties and "
"behaviors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scenes created with those entities."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actuators that extend the predefined behaviors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These building blocks can be reused to create custom scenes, new games and "
"many learning materials."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The recommended installation method is through the software center of the "
"system, e.g., *GNOME Software*. Thematic packs are offered as addons from "
"the software center page. Alternatively, it can also be installed from "

msgid ""
"Once in the game, the scene takes most of the screen but there are other "
"elements as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The [HUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_games)) is an interface "
"placed at the bottom center of the screen. This element is used to visualize"
" the user's character stats. It's composed of the following parts:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A green bar that represents the user's character durability, e.g., to "
"monitor the health of the character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A blue bar that represents the user's character stamina, e.g., to estimate "
"how many actions can be performed by the character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An icon slot to display the entity that is currently being held by the "
"user's character, e.g., to determine what tool the character is equipped "
"with."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another element is the dialogue viewer. This viewer is placed at the bottom "
"of the screen and it's used to display in-game dialogues, e.g., a message "

msgstr ""

msgid "A light blue section that contains the dialogue text."
msgstr ""

msgid "A button to close the dialogue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Controls"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once in the game, the user's character can be controlled with two methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keyboard controls. To see the full list of key bindings, go the menu and "
"select the *Keyboard Shortcuts* option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mouse controls. To see the available actions, right-click on the game view "

msgstr ""

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The user's character can perform multiple actions to interact with the game "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Move* to advance the user's character to one of four directions, e.g., to "
"move the character to the *North*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Take* to hold an entity from the scene. The entity must be directly in "
"front of the user's character to be taken, e.g., to grab the entity and move"
" that it later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Use* to apply any effects that the entity being held might have. These "
"effects affect the entities that are located right in front of the user's "
"character, e.g., to chop some logs with an axe."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Drop* to stop holding an entity, e.g., to stop moving it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Interact* to activate any behavior from an entity. To interact with another"
" entity, the entity must be located right in front of the user's character, "
"e.g., to activate a teleport or read from signs."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Rotate* to change the direction of the user's character."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Stop* to stop any action being performed and simply idle."
msgstr ""

msgid "Save files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The state of the game can be saved at any moment and restored later. Save "
"files are full copies of the scene and therefore regular scene files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To save the state of the game, go to the menu and select the *Save As‚Ä¶* "
"option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To restore the state of the game, follow the same steps described above to "

msgstr ""

msgid "Cooperative game play"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gameeky was designed from the ground up to create and share cooperative "
"experiences. All the games created with it can be played cooperatively. "
"There are no special requirements. Although there's no theoretical limit as "
"for how many users can join a cooperative game, there are technical "
"limitations. E.g., limited computing resources."
msgstr ""

msgid "To start a cooperative game, follow these steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the creation dialog, increase the number of participants and then click"

msgstr ""

msgid "To join a cooperative game:"
msgstr ""

msgid "From the player, go to the menu and select the *Join* option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the join dialog, specify the [IP "
"address](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gabmus.whatip) of the user who started"
" the cooperative game and click on the *Join* button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"üìù **Note:** All the users joining a cooperative game must have a copy of the"
" same thematic pack or project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"üìù **Note:** Custom scenes created from thematic packs don't need to be "
"shared. The scene is automatically shared during game play, as long as all "
"users share the same thematic pack."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"üìù **Note:** Users can join a session as any entity defined in the thematic "
"pack, e.g., as a tree or a rock. To do this, expand the *Advance* section of"
" the creation or join dialog and select a different *Entity Type*."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scene editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scene editor lets users create and modify game worlds. It serves as the "
"initial and simplest form of no-code creation experience in Gameeky."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To edit an existing Scene, click on the *Edit* button of the project from "
"the launcher. To create a new scene it's recommended to start off an "
"existing project such as a thematic pack. Follow these steps to add a new "
"Scene:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the launcher, click on the *Options* button of the project and select "
"the *Edit* option."
msgstr ""

msgid "From the scene editor, go to the menu and select the *New* option."

"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tchx84/Gameeky/main/data/screenshots/en/01.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Concepts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A scene is a collection of entities arranged in a tiles grid. The basic "
"properties of a scene are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A *Name* that must be unique among the scenes of the same project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Time* of the day in which the scene occurs. It can be *Day*, *Night* or"
" *Dynamic*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *Dynamic*, the *Duration* specifies the number of seconds that it takes "
"to complete a full day and night cycle. Otherwise this property is ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Width* of the scene specifies the total number of tiles on the "
"horizontal axis."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Height* of the scene specifies the total number of tiles on the "
"vertical axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Workflow"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scene editing workflow resembles one of a painting tool. Entities are "
"painted and removed to and from the scene. The basic steps to edit a scene "
"are the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add entities to the scene, select an entity from the left panel and place"
" it on the scene by clicking on a tile in the grid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To remove entities from the scene, select the *Remove* tool from the left "
"and then click on the entity tile in the grid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although entities come with predefined properties and behaviors, particular "
"entities in the scene can be customized. Select the *Edit* tool from the "
"left panel and then click on the entity tile in the grid."
msgstr ""

msgid "To test the scene, go to the menu and select the *Try It* option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, the scene editor provides helpers to make things easier such "
"as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drawing area selector to add or remove multiple entities at once, e.g., to "
"quickly create the scene terrain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Layer selector to modify entities at a specific layer, e.g., to quickly "
"modify the scene terrain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Time selector to visualize the scene during *Day* or *Night*, e.g., to "
"inspect the light sources in the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tips and tricks"
msgstr ""

msgid "For an improved experience, try the following tips and tricks:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating the basic terrain of the scene, use the layer selector and set"
" it at *Layer 0*. This will reduce the unnecessary overlapping of terrain "
"tiles and it will ease the editing workflow overall."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When editing a scene, leave the player open on that scene. When changes to "
"the scene are saved, the player will detect these changes and present an "
"option to reload the scene with the new changes. This reduces the time "
"switching between the scene editor and the player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When editing a scene, use the initial location setter tool from the left "
"panel to place the user's character in a convenient location to inspect the "
"changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "The entity editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The entity editor lets users create and modify game objects and creatures. "
"It provides a deeper no-code creation experience, as it requires "
"understanding the underlying systems of Gameeky."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before creating a new entity from scratch, it's recommended to inspect "
"existing entities from thematic packs. So, to inspect an existing entity "
"follow these steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid "From the scene editor, right-click on an entity in the left panel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Select the *Edit* option from the menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a new entity:"
msgstr ""

msgid "From the scene editor, right-click anywhere in the left panel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Select the *Add* option from the menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tchx84/Gameeky/main/data/screenshots/en/03.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Entities represent everything that can exist in the game, e.g., the grass, "
"the user's character, a light source, the background music and even the game"
" logic. An entity is composed of three parts:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Game logic properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Graphics."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Game logic properties"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These properties determine how entities behave and interact with other "
"entities, e.g., different combinations of these properties will determine "
"whether an entity is acting as a static stone or a living foe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although there are two dozen properties, a few of these require special "
"attention here:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Identifier* must be unique among all the entities of the same project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An entity is always in one and a single *State*, e.g., *Idling*, *Moving*, "
"*Destroyed*, etc. The state can change by performing different actions, by "
"intrinsic or extrinsic means."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An entity is always pointing to one and a single *Direction*. It can be "
"*North*, *East*, *South* or *West*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An entity state can be changed intrinsically by *Actuators* that provide "
"predefined logic, e.g., a *Roams* actuator will move the entity to random "
"directions, and a *Destroys* actuator will flag the entity for removal from "
"the scene when its durability reaches zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All entity properties coexist in a single system and therefore behaviors can"
" emerge from different combinations of these properties, e.g., the speed in "
"which an entity can move is determined by its *Weight* and its *Strength*, "
"while the total weight of an entity depends on the weight of the entity its "
"holding, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"üìù **Note:** When creating a new thematic pack assume that the entity with "
"identifier number *1* will be assigned to the user's character in the game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Graphics"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Entities are represented on the screen through 2D graphics, which can be "
"static or animated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These graphics are assigned to specific combinations of state and direction,"
" e.g., a specific animation will be rendered when an entity is *Moving* to "
"the *West*, while another animation will be rendered when the same entity is"
" *Idling* to the *South*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All entities must provide a *Default* graphic, e.g., to visualize it on the "
"scene editor or debug plugins."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sounds"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly to graphics, entities can emit sounds when in specific states, "
"e.g., footsteps sound is played when the entity is *Moving*. Directions "
"don't matter here."
msgstr ""

msgid "There aren't *Default* sounds, as sounds are optional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The entity creation workflow is similar to filling a form or a template. The"
" most basic entity is created with the following steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under the *Game* tab, start setting the values from top to bottom. Note that"
" all properties provide their own defaults. Only the identifier is "
"mandatory. Setting a name is recommended so that it's easier to find the "
"entity on the scene editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under the *Graphics* tab, click on the *Add* button to create the first and "
"default animation. Leave both *State* and *Direction* to *Default*. Expand "
"the *Details* section of the default animation to select an image. Click on "
"the *View* button to inspect the selected image."
msgstr ""

msgid "Save the entity and use it from the scene editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a new entity, always begin with setting the identifier number "
"and then *Save* the Entity to disk. Keep the name suggested by the entity "
"editor. This will make it easier to assign unique identifiers along the "
"road."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When adding new assets, use the *Browse Files* option from the menu to "
"quickly access the project's folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a new animation, always leave both, the entity editor and the "
"tileset viewer, open side by side. This will make it easier to set up the "
"animation frames."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After creating an animation, click on the *Copy* button to add the next "
"animation. This will make it easier to set up the next animation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The code editor and LOGO-like code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Having support for cooperative game play opens the door for cooperators that"
" can be controlled with code. To achieve this, Gameeky provides a small "
"library that enables users to control a single Entity using Python, in a "
"LOGO-like experience."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Follow these steps to start a cooperative game:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the creation dialog, increased the number of participants and then "
"click on the *Create* button."
msgstr ""

msgid "To join the game with code, these steps must be followed:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the player, go to the menu and select the *Join With Code* option."
msgstr ""

msgid "Write Python code that uses the Gameeky library, see examples below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click on the *Play* button."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples"
msgstr ""

msgid "Join and leave a [game](../../../../src/gameeky/library/game.py):"

msgid ""
"Actuators can modify the behavior of an entity. A single entity can use "
"multiple actuators to model more complex behaviors. Although there's a wide "
"range of predefined actuators, the end result is limited when compared to "
"actual code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Therefore, Gameeky provides support for user-created actuators to go beyond "
"what the predefined actuators can do."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are three types of actuators:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regular actuators enact on each tick of the scene, e.g., to "
"[move](../../../../src/gameeky/server/game/actuators/roams.py) the entity to"
" a random location on each tick."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Activatable actuators enact only in fixed time intervals or when explicitly "
"activated by another entity, e.g., to "
"[spawn](../../../../src/gameeky/server/game/actuators/spawns.py) a new foe "
"to the scene every five seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Interactable actuators enact when other entities interact with its entity, "
"e.g., to "
"[teleport](../../../../src/gameeky/server/game/actuators/teleports.py) an "
"entity to a different location when that entity interacts with a portal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All actuators use their own entity game properties to modify their behavior:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Target Name* and *Target Type* properties can be used to filter the "
"entities affected by the actuator, e.g., to "
"[target](../../../../src/gameeky/server/game/actuators/aggroes.py) only "
"certain entities types for aggression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Rate* property can be used in activatables to reduce the activation "
"frequency, e.g., to "
"[hatch](../../../../src/gameeky/server/game/actuators/transmutes.py) an egg "
"into a chicken after ten seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Radius* property can be used to determine the area of effect of an "
"actuator, e.g., to "
"[burn](../../../../src/gameeky/server/game/actuators/affects.py) entities "
"when stepping into a fire."
